* and the interest rate are input by the user. The value of
* the investment at the end of the year is output. The
* rate must be input as a decimal, not a percentage (for
* example, 0.05 rather than 5).

//  "%10s" = "s" the value should be output in its default format 10 min numbers
//  "%1.2f" = formats for money 2 decimals or "%1.5f" 5 decimal places;
//  1 min num spaces so if "%12.3f" right-justify 12 with 3 decimal places
//  "%15.8e" = used for exponets format 8 determins how many to use after
//  decimal
//  "%1.8g" = same as "e" but 8 includes number before decimal
